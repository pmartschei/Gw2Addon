Since a long time, I always wanted to have something changed when vendoring items (especially sigils and runes). Because ANet didn't deliver, I thought that it must be possible to sell specific items from your inventory via an addon.

Before you download the .dll you should read [README.md](https://github.com/Qouve/IncQol/blob/master/README.md) in the github where you can find all informations about the addon.

##What does this addon do?

- Filter items from your inventory
- Sell filtered items when pressing "Sell Junk" in any vendor tab
